# TODO
- change the alert message to display only for 3-5 seconds each time it does, then disappear
- insert line chart for historical stock data
- change the code in keys so that it returns the local server if local server is active, or remote glitch server if not
- 

# Project info
to change from local to web server: Keys.js file

# Description
This react project utilizes a flask framework for the backend to handle user authorization and CRUD capabilities for a user and the user's own objects, specifically stocks and other investments. This is a stock application much like robinhood, or any other brokerage account, but there is as of yet no functionality when trying to invest real cash into the application; it's a mock stock investment application. The objective is to get users excited about investing in stocks and other exchange traded assets, so that they can get a taste of what it means to invest in real stocks. 

Future improvements include implementing Plaid integration so that a user can bring money into the account. Also, adding an actual chart in the user's portfolio which monitors their historical changing portfolio value. Also, adding real-time stock price movements wherever a stock is displayed so that it updates either every second or few seconds for the user's convenience. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
